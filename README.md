## Project Objective: 
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize data on the number of nurseries, their availability at the national level and across voivodeships, as well as the monthly costs associated with childcare and their regional distribution. 
Additionally, interactive reports have been developed to enable efficient filtering and searching of nurseries across the country based on selected criteria, such as location and price range, providing users with a clear and data-driven overview of childcare accessibility. 

## Dataset Involved:
The project is based on open data published by the Central Statistical Office of Poland. The dataset includes information on institutions listed in the Register of Nurseries and Children's Clubs as of February 2025, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of childcare facilities across the country.

## Key Insights:
#### Country-level 
- Poland has nearly 5,900 nurseries, but availability remains a challenge, with a significant portion of spots already occupied. 

- The cost of childcare varies widely, with monthly fees ranging from 0 zł to 4,000 zł, and notable regional disparities. 

- Only 43% of nurseries are adapted for children with disabilities, highlighting the need for improved accessibility. 

- Weekend childcare options are extremely limited, with just 72 nurseries open on Saturdays and 30 on Sundays. 

- A large majority (83%) of childcare facilities are traditional nurseries, while children's clubs make up only 17% of the sector.

#### Voivodeship-level 
- Mazowieckie, Śląskie, and Małopolskie have the highest nursery demand, yet their fees are among the highest—additional subsidies or expanded capacity could improve affordability and accessibility. 

- Zachodniopomorskie and Podkarpackie have the fewest nurseries adapted for disabled children, highlighting a need for better inclusion efforts and funding in these regions. 

- Lubuskie and Podkarpackie have the lowest nursery fees, but also fewer available spots, suggesting that increasing the number of nurseries in these areas could improve accessibility. 

- Meal costs significantly impact overall childcare expenses, especially when exceeding 18.26 zł per day-introducing meal subsidies or cost regulations could make nurseries more affordable. 

- Despite high subsidy rates in many voivodeships, nursery fees remain high in places like Małopolskie-evaluating the effectiveness of subsidies and adjusting funding distribution could better support families.
